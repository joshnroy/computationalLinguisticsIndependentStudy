# About the Tinder Bot
## Purpose
The purpose of this tinder bot is not to flirt with people or attempt to get dates. Rather, its purpose is to use tinder as a set of learning/testing data to learn how to speak English and respond to common phrases.
## Why Tinder
Tinder happens to be a very fruitful place to find casual conversation. In addition, it is up 24 hours a day and would allow the bot to assign itself feedback based on how long (in messages) it is able to hold a conversation. In addition, it would enable the bot to learn common speech patterns used by humans without direct supervision from the user of the program. In essence, the program could be left running overnight and continue learning.
