# Word bigrams are just pairs of words.
# In the sentence "I went to the beach"
# the bigrams are:
#    I went
#    went to
#    to the
#    the beach
#
# Having counts of English bigrams from a very large text corpus
# can be useful for a number of purposes.
#
# for example for spelling correction:
# If I had mistyped the sentence as "I went to beach"
# then I might be able to find the error by seeing that
# the bigram "to beach" has a very low count, and
# "to the", "to a", and "the beach" have much larger counts.
#
# This program counts all word bigrams in a given text file
#
# usage:
# python count_bigrams.py <filename>
# 
# <filename> is a text file.
